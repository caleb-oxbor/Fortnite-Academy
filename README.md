Extended and Refined Proposal - 2 Pages
Problem: What problem are we trying to solve?
	In the competitive landscape of online first-person shooter video games, particularly within the popular battle royale video game "Fortnite," players continually strive to improve their skills and gameplay strategies. However, a significant challenge these players face is the lack of a comprehensive, accessible tool to evaluate their performance metrics effectively. These metrics include but are not limited to kill-to-death ratio (K/D), win rate, average damage dealt, and many other statistics that provide insight into a player's skill and areas needing improvement. Fortnite players need access to a large, accurate, and easy-to-use dataset or platform that allows them to compare their gameplay statistics against the average metrics of the broader player community. This comparison is crucial for identifying strengths and weaknesses in their gameplay, setting realistic improvement goals, and tracking their progress over time. Without such a tool, players are left to guesswork, hindering their ability to improve strategically and efficiently.
Our project, "Fortnite Academy," seeks to address this gap by developing a free resource where Fortnite players can calculate their performance metrics, compare them with community averages, and receive tailored advice on specific areas for improvement. By leveraging a dataset with over 50,000 data points across various game modes, we aim to provide a robust platform for player analysis and development.

Motivation: Why is this a problem?
	Our team developed the Fortnite Academy project to aid competitive gamers in enhancing their skills. Nevertheless, players' limited access to comprehensive self-assessment tools hampers their capacity for targeted self-improvement. This is particularly pertinent in a game like Fortnite, where success is measured by dynamic gameplay and continually evolving strategies. We are motivated to equip every player with the necessary tools to evaluate their performance, compare it against others, and identify clear paths toward improvement. Our computer science expertise and our passion for gaming enable us to make a meaningful contribution to the Fortnite community.
